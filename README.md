# Lunar and Martian Crater Detection and Landing Site Analysis
**Updates:**
I added a clearer landing suitability heatmap (changing from 32x32 pixels to 1x1), making the model slower...
NEWEST VERSION: 1.2

**Objective:**
Crater detection and bounding box localization
Terrain steepness and type classification
Landing site suitability assessment

### Research findings

- The slope of the given landing site needs to be <5° to meet HLS lander terrain requirements.

- For landing safety, crater-free and flat regions are optimal for spacecarft landing.
