# Lunar and Martian Crater Detection and Landing Site Analysis

**Objective:**
Crater detection and bounding box localization
Terrain steepness and type classification
Landing site suitability assessment

### Research findings

- The slope of the given landing site needs to be <5° to meet HLS lander terrain requirements.
